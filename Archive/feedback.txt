Fix the (left) (right) captions

Peter liked it. Visibly unfinished - spelling errors.

Confused with Fig. 11.

Fig. 10 - Fix label of integration time (a) and (b)

Combine Fig. 9 and Fig. 10

Do a better job analyzing the differences of 

When talking about main result and in Sec. 2.2, 
be clear about dimension when introducing div rate

Colors of Fig. 2 should match Fig. 1

rhoT should be discribed as 

Get rid of "something like" -> "Time normalized slope of normal distance"

In 2nd paragraph of main result

As shown in "appendix" A

Fig. 3 has a bunch of dots

contourf and set it to hundreds of levels

Be more specific about what would be attracting and repelling curve for rhoT
We get attracting and repelling curves all at once! Big selling point!

Spell out that "true curve" is within totally attracting and repelling regions

Use insets to highlight curves

Update Eq (31) to be an integral

Fig. 7, y_0 should be \phi_0

Use diagnostic in the introduction

Update higher dimensional figure

Be sure to specify hyperbolic

The end of the first sentence sounds weird

Sometimes say "we." Feels inconsistent, and like it's unnecessary

	Dear Editor, \\
	We are submitting the manuscript titled ``Trajectory-free approximation of phase space structures using the trajectory divergence rate'' by Gary K. Nave, Jr., Peter J. Nolan, and Shane D. Ross. %In this work, we consider the dynamics of a model of passively gliding flight and observe a globally attracting normally hyperbolic invariant manifold in phase space. Because of the aerodynamic nature of the model, we refer to this structure as the terminal velocity manifold. We provide an analysis of the system, present several numerical methods for calculating this manifold, and show how it relates to classic behaviors of passive descent in extended phase space.
	
%	We believe that this work would be of interest to the applied nonlinear dynamical systems community, as it presents the application of a number of dynamical systems techniques to an interesting model.
	
	Sincerely, \\

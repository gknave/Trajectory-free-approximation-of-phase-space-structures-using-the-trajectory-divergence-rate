1. Fixed typo
2. Done. Added two new references (Wiggins et al. 2001 and Dellnitz et la. 2005) to account for these references.
3. Added sentence citing Lagrangian descriptors.
4. Removed the explicit equation reference and added definition of R.
5. I think I'll simply reply to this in the response to reviewers. I don't see a place where it makes sense to discuss this within the paper, and the Lekien/Ross paper is already referenced.
6. Removed duplicate definition.
7. Added missing word.
8. Broke up 2nd equation to show missing k=1, k\geq2
9. Fixed typo
10. Clarified sentence.
11. Done. Changed to green for visibility. (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2)
12. Problem caused by problem 8. Eq (8) was too wide for one column.
13. Fixed.
14. Fixed.
15. Darkened both the streamlines and the phase plot arrows, in addition to
decreasing the density of streamlines. 
16. I moved this discussion to the end of the "Notes" I think it makes a better transition to the next section. I may need to re-read it to make sure the ideas flow logically.
17. Removed this thought. I'm really not sure where it was going.
18. Done.
19. Removed ref. to red curve, replaced with ``negative ridge of TDR''
20. Clarified that minimization is local in several places.
21. Replaced v^2 with v_x^2+v_z^2
22. Fixed the sentence. Added mnflds to figure.
23. Fixed now. Mistake actually in the text, caption was correct.
24. Done. Will add comment to response that values are small in bottom half of figure.
25. Completed the sentence. May need to re-read the paragraph to make sure it
makes sense.
26. Fixed typo.
